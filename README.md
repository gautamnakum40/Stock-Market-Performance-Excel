# Stock Market Performance Analysis 

## Overview
This project conducts an EDA of historical stock price data from multiple companies to uncover key trends, volatility, and performance over time. Using Excel, the analysis provides an interactive dashboard for dynamic exploration of stock data, enabling users to filter by specific stock tickers, time periods, and price movements.

## Objective
To analyze historical stock price data to gain insights into stock performance, trends, and volatility.By using Excelâ€™s built-in tools (such as slicers, timelines, and charts), the project aims to assist investors and decision-makers in making data-driven investment choices by identifying stock trends, understanding market behavior, and assessing risk.

### Key Areas of Focus:
- Stock price trends over time using moving averages and time-series analysis
- Volatility analysis to assess stock price fluctuations
- Correlation analysis to understand relationships between different stocks
- Descriptive statistics to summarize key performance metrics
- Dashboard to visualize stock performance and key insights

## Summary and Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are made:
##### **Moving Average Strategy**: 
Investors can use the 50-day moving average as a guide for buy/sell decisions, buying when the stock price crosses above the MA 50 and selling when it falls below.

##### **Volatility Monitoring**: 
Keep an eye on periods of high volatility, as they present both risks and opportunities. Risk-averse investors may prefer to avoid highly volatile stocks, while more aggressive investors might capitalize on these movements.

##### **Diversification**: 
Leverage the insights from the correlation matrix to diversify portfolios. Avoid stocks with high positive correlations to reduce risk and ensure better portfolio performance during market downturns.

## Conclusion
This project offers valuable insights into stock performance, volatility, and relationships between stocks. The analysis can support data-driven decision-making in the stock market, helping investors optimize their portfolios and manage risk effectively.
