## Summary and Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are made:
##### **Moving Average Strategy**: 
Investors can use the 50-day moving average as a guide for buy/sell decisions, buying when the stock price crosses above the MA 50 and selling when it falls below.

##### **Volatility Monitoring**: 
Keep an eye on periods of high volatility, as they present both risks and opportunities. Risk-averse investors may prefer to avoid highly volatile stocks, while more aggressive investors might capitalize on these movements.

##### **Diversification**: 
Leverage the insights from the correlation matrix to diversify portfolios. Avoid stocks with high positive correlations to reduce risk and ensure better portfolio performance during market downturns.

## Conclusion
This project offers valuable insights into stock performance, volatility, and relationships between stocks. The analysis can support data-driven decision-making in the stock market, helping investors optimize their portfolios and manage risk effectively.
